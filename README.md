Fullstack Internship Technical Task: Building a To-Do List Application

## Objective:
Your task is to create a simple To-Do List application using Django as the backend framework and ReactJS as the frontend library. The application should allow users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Time Duration:
48 hours

## Requirements:

## Backend (Django):

-- Create a Django project and set up a virtual environment.
Design a model for tasks with the following fields: title, description, due_date, completed.
Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
Use appropriate serializers to handle data serialization and deserialization.
Implement necessary error handling and validation.
Use a database of your choice (SQLite is recommended for simplicity).
Frontend (ReactJS):

## Set up a ReactJS project using Create React App or any preferred setup.
Create components for the following:
Task list display
Task creation
Task editing
Fetch tasks from the backend API and display them in a list.
Implement functionality to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Implement the ability to mark tasks as completed.
Style the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.
Integration:

## Connect the frontend and backend parts of the application.
Use appropriate HTTP methods for making API requests from the frontend.
Ensure seamless communication between the two ends.
Extras (Optional, if time permits):

## Add user authentication and allow each user to have their own set of tasks.
Implement task sorting and filtering options (e.g., by due date, completion status).
Incorporate visual cues for task priorities (e.g., color-coded based on due date).
Submission:

## Upon completion, please provide the following:

A GitHub repository with the complete source code.
Instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
Evaluation:

## Your task will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements?
Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
User Interface: Is the frontend intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing?
Technical Choices: Did you use appropriate technologies and libraries for the task?
Integration: Is there seamless communication between the frontend and backend?
Bonus Features: Any extra features beyond the basic requirements will be considered a plus.
Note: Feel free to reach out if you have any questions during the task. Good luck, and we're excited to see your work!
